I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</blockquote> </article> <article class="testimonial__article testimonial__article--grid-item-two testimonial__article--theme-gray"> <div class="testimonial__profile"> <img class="profile__img" src="image-jonathan.693fb75e.jpg" alt="jonathans profile picture"> <div> <p class="profile__name">Jonathan Walters</p> <p class="profile__graduate">Verified Graduate</p> </div> </div> <h2 class="testimonial__headline">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h2> <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills.

Highly recommended!</h2> <blockquote class="testimonial__quote">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</blockquote> </article> </div> </main> <footer class="attribution"> Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>.
